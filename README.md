## Introduction

Welcome to my **Data Science Path** repository! 
This is where I document my journey from a Computer Engineering freshman to mastering Data Science and Machine Learning. This collection includes my practice notebooks, code snippets, and explorations into data visualization and algorithmic logic.

My goal is to build a strong foundation in **Data Processing** and **Model Building** to apply them in future **AIoT & Hardware** projects (like Jetson Nano & FPGA).
